Ashish_theatreSeating

This is the project for theatre seating arrangement.

it is based on following model : A) it tries to fit the biggest group to smallest section 
B) than it compacts and moves groups sitting at back to bring in front. 
C) check if no section can accomodate, than if row can - call split group. 
D) if row cannot accomodate group calls cannot entertain the group.

this is as per below : 1. Fill as many orders as possible 
2. Put parties as close to the front as possible. 
3. If there are not enough seats available in the theater to handle a party, tell them "Sorry, we can't handle your party." 
4. Each party must sit in a single row in a single section. If they won't fit, tell them "Call to split party".

also,

it has nUNit test cases. for TDD.
